We have a whole damn ZK instance in the testing framework:
  - Ideally, rip it out and mock, but that might not be possible / ideal, so:
  - If we continue to use real ZK, throw a check in the test that alarms if tests are run with a ZK_VERSION diff from setup.cfg
  - fix version diffs, some parts of CP are using 7.1
  - Maven pull a fat jar so that giant ungodly tox.ini flag can go away
  

Asserts -> appropriate errors:
  all ValueErrors?
  custom Error?

Either way, stop throwing away exception data at low levels while reraising exception higher. 

Also would be cool to shorten some stack traces, but see above, might have to pick one goal out of two, not both.

Redo testing harness as mixin
